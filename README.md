# Artema Medical - Medical Equipment Manufacturer Website

## Project Overview
This project is a simple static website for Artema Medical, a medical equipment manufacturer and supplier. The site showcases their products, company information, and certifications while providing a user-friendly interface for visitors to learn more about their offerings. Features include sections for product categories, testimonials, and a call-to-action to encourage users to contact the company.

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/artema-medical.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd artema-medical
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

You don't need any server setup as this is a static site, but you can use Live Server or similar tools in code editors like Visual Studio Code for a better development experience.

## Usage
Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser. The website includes a header with navigation links, hero section, product categories, a showcase of best-selling products, and testimonials. Click on the "Contact Us" button to simulate contacting the company.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The site adapts to various screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on mobile devices.
- **Interactive Elements**: The navigation menu and product category buttons offer a smooth user experience with animations.
- **Testimonials Carousel**: Review testimonials from satisfied clients to build trust with potential customers.
- **Call to Action**: Prominent call-to-action buttons encourage engagement.

## Dependencies
This project does not have an external dependency management system such as a `package.json` file since it is a static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All required files are included within this project.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure and content of the website.
- `styles.css`: The stylesheet that defines the visual appearance of the website, including layout, color schemes, and interactive styles.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles interactive functionalities such as mobile navigation toggle, product category button interaction, testimonial carousel, and animations.
